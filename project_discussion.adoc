== Features required/suggested by NDRI Team in Pedometers
. Battery lifecycle on a single charge (21-23 days) minimum
. Pedometer should measures Behavioural Parameters
.. Walking steps
.. Standing time
.. Sleeping time
.. Chewing time
.. Ruminating time
. Wireless Data Transfer (twice a day on specific locations like milking parlour)
. Height of the existing pedometers should be less as compare to existing pedometer (32mm)

== Existing Pedometer Features
. Battery life cycle on a single charge (2 days)
. Step counts
. Data Storage in SD card
. Data transfer via WiFi (available)

== Earlier plannned development of Pedometer
. reduced pedometer case height to 24 mm. (working to case designing)
. use of LoRa for data transfer to gateway then to database server. (successfully established connection between lora module to lorawan gateway) 

== Existing Hardware components in Pedometer
. M5ATOM matrix (esp32 + mp6556)
. SD card reader + SD card
. RTC Clock IC (DS3231)
. Battery 800 maH (Li-po battery)
. ESP32 module (wifi+bluetooth+microcontroller) (planned to add)
. IMU Sensors (LSM9DS1) (planned to add)
. LoRa (RFM95W 865-868MHz) module (planned to add)


== Design challenges

. How power can be saved ?

Idea 1{empty}footnote:[The idea is suggested by Dr. T.K. Mohanty Sir] :: [.yellow]++Increase the battery size and quality++ But, this will [.red]++increase the++ +
[.red]++weight of the module which may create problems to cows.++

Idea 2{empty}footnote:[The idea is suggested by Dr. T.K. Mohanty Sir and Dr. Mukesh Bhakat Sir based on their observations] :: Do not take measurements all the time 
instead of it, just try to record +
for some specific time periods for sometimes, let say 15-20 mins/day, +
try to predict what will the total number of steps taken by that cows in + 
this way we may able to get a battery lifecycle of 30 days, + 
[.red]++But this will definitely decreases the device accuracy which is our one of the most concerned area.++

Idea 3{empty}footnote:[Based on discussion with Prof. Subrat Kar Sir and Sahil Sir] :: We may use msp430 microcontroller or some similar low +
power microcontroller interfaced with BLE device, to send data +
and reduce power consumption in which may increase the battery lifecycle on a single charge.

. How to fix the pedometer near neck region of the cows with displacing in its own?

== Classification Challenges
. How can we classify different behavioural parameters based on acclerometer datas only?

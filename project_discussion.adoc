== Features required/suggested by NDRI Team in Pedometers
. Battery lifecycle on a single charge (21-23 days) minimum
. Pedometer should measures Behavioural Parameters
.. Walking steps
.. Standing time
.. Sleeping time
.. Chewing time
.. Ruminating time
. Wireless Data Transfer (twice a day) (preferably BLE, LoRa)
. Height of the existing pedometers should be less as compare to existing pedometer (32mm)

== Existing Pedometer Features
. Battery life cycle on a single charge (2 days)
. Step counts
. Data Storage in SD card
. Data transfer via WiFi (available)

== Earlier plannned development of Pedometer
. reduced pedometer case height to 24 mm. (working to case designing)
. use of LoRa for data transfer to gateway then to database server. (successfully established connection between lora module to lorawan gateway) 

== Existing Hardware components in Pedometer
. ESP32 module (wifi+bluetooth+microcontroller)
. SD card reader + SD card
. Battery 800 maH (Li-po battery)
. LoRa (RFM95W 865-868MHz) module (planned to add)


== Design challenges
. How power can be saved ?
[horizontal]
Idea 1 :: Increase the battery size and quality But, this will [.red] ++increase the++ +
weight of the module which may create problems.
[horizontal]
Idea 2 :: Do not take measurements all the time 
instead of it, just try to + 
record for some specific time periods for sometimes, let say 15-20 mins a day
